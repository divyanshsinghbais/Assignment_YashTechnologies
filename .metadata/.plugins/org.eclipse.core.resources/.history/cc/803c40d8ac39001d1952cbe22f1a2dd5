  Create class/interface Shape which will have only one method area. 
Create class Triangle, Square and Rectangle all will extends/implements Shape. 
In class Triangle, Square and Rectangle depending upon the 
number of sides you have to react the co-ordinates of the vertex. For 
example triangle having three vertex so name each vertex A,B and C. 
now you have to read the x & y co-ordinates of A,B and C, after that you 
have find the distance between the vertex A, B and C after this you have 
to calculate the Area and print Area. Same process will be applied while 
calculating area of Square and Rectangle.
